## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**`Automatic License Plate Detection`** detects license plate and its characters using `YOLO` by [Pratigya Paudel](https://github.com/pratigya2), [Sushank Ghimire](https://github.com/sushankgghimire), [Pratima Dawadi](https://github.com/pratima-dawadi) and [Rashmi Khadka](https://github.com/Rashmii23).This System is designed to take a vehicle image and video as an input derived from the extraction and cropping of motorized vehicle videos that had been taken using cellphones and cameras. Then the text is extracted from the number plate after recognizing it.`Transfer Learning`, `Image Processing`and `Computer Vision` were major concepts used in this project.

We have used YOLOv5 for number plate detection, also YOLOv5 for character segmentation finally integrated all the models with django webapp for user interaction.
